                            <b>description:</b> In an immersive, challenging, and engaging gameplay with randomized enemies and enviroment; players
                            can explore this mysterious planet, collecting precious minerals in hopes to repair their spaceship and escape.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>process:</b> The main focus of mine was incorporating the lighting throughout the game and adding a day-night cycle for
                            the enemy spawn waves. Once a timer was incorporated, I started working on the lighting source. Since we were using the default
                            template and not a URP (Universal Render Pipeline), applying the standard light source was impossible. The workaround used
                            was to add a diffuse mask to the background/layers and using a directional light source while adjusting the intensity based on 
                            the timer. This will give the dusk/dawn/inbetween affects.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>reflection:</b> After completing this semester and having little to no group projects, this was quite the hurdle. luckily, 
                            we all were working really well together and communicated whenever issues arose. I learned a lot in terms of developing code/games 
                            in a group environment as well as self motivation. It was challenging to stay motivated throughout the semester when other, shorter
                            projects were more enticing, but keeping to the weekly stand-ups we had allowed for us to keep our focus on the smaller parts to 
                            complete. 
                            <br>
                            A larger challenge we struggled with was scope creep. We would see the developments being made throughout the term and
                            want to keep adding to them rather than focus on the next important issue. Although it was a struggle, we overcame it a bit by 
                            scheduling a 'reset' meeting to get us back on track.

                            <b>description:</b> A 2D prey-preditor ecosystem simulator based on the Savitch's 
                            'Doodlebugs'. The simulation has to stay balanced for around 100-200 generations and 
                            cannot exceed 1000 generations. Additionally, we were to focus on and implement the four 
                            pillars of coding, APIE (A-abstraction, P-polymorphism, I-inheritance, E-encapsulation), to make 
                            this work.

                            <b>process:</b> Not getting too confused early on was my biggest focus, yet I still had troubles 
                            wrapping my head around the code. Working on the polymorphism and inheritance were concepts that made
                            sense to me but when implementing them added a little of confusion. I started with the parent classes
                            and slowly built the world and child classes around them. This was followed with the implementation
                            of the different species' rules (i.e. where they can move, if they can eat/reproduce, etc.) and 
                            making sure they work properly with the world class during each iteration of the simulation.

                            <b>reflection:</b> Shown above was the outcome of my simulation with 100 humans and 25 zombies 
                            at the start. This is the final generation before the simulation ended with humans prevailing. 
                            although this was one of the most challenging assignments throughout this program, it was 
                            also one of the most fun to accomplish. I was able to watch my efforts progress in real time 
                            which doesn't happen too often. I'm positive learning and implementing the four pillars of coding 
                            will stay with me no matter where my career takes me.

                            per pizza is what was delivered. The user would be able to access all previously entered orders wih the 
                            capabilities to both edit and delete them (CRUD).

                            <b>process:</b> Designing the application and choosing a theme took some time, but writing the event handlers 
                            to properly pass and receive the correct data was tricky. Not only was it for the basic forward/backward navigation 
                            of the app, but also when it came to adding the database to it. I focused on the basic events to start off and 
                            added the most complicated ones to prevent getting too confused. 
                            <br>
                            Throughout the course, testing your applications for all potential bugs was of importance. This forced me to spend
                            more time than normal verifying each button/feature to work as intended. Easier said than done when working in 
                            an unfamiliar language.

                            speaker, I wanted to choose a less familiar language to translate the app to, which led me to mandarin. luckily
                            I have friends and family who speak it and requested their assistance when it came to that, but it was a lot of 
                            fun learning more about the language through pizza.
