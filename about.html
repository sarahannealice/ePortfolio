            <p class="introduction">Hi! I'm Sarah!</p>
            <p>I am an Indigenous woman interested in problem solving and creating things from nothing. The AI and video
                game industry are interests of mine.</p>
            <p>Previously, I completed a degree in Geology with a minor in French. Currently, I'm enrolled in my
                second year of studies at NSCC completing a diploma in IT Programming. In addition to the above,
                I have also completed 1 of a 2 year diploma in Video Game Animation! Learning has always been 
                something enjoyable for me and I look forward to furthering my knowledge in the IT field.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing badminton competitvely, bouldering, crocheting, knitting
                and anything hands on/creative! As one can assume from my background, I enjoy being outdoors, 
                playing video games with friends and learning languages. When I was younger, a goal of mine to 
                learn multiple languages fluently and I'm happy to say this hasn't changed and it's still a work
                in progress. ^^'
            </p>
            <p>Although I could continue writing this biography about me, it would mean a lot to me if we could
                connect mutually! I look forward to hearing from you through 'contact'!</p>
